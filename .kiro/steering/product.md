# Product Overview

The Gopher Séance is a Halloween-themed resurrection project that revives the obsolete Gopher protocol through an AI-powered digital séance experience.

## Core Concept

Users submit queries to a "Digital Medium" agent that searches a Gopher Archive (JSON data structure representing the dead protocol) and returns cryptic, haunting interpretations. The experience combines:

- Retro CRT monitor aesthetics with spooky visual effects
- Background music that amplifies during séances
- Text-to-speech narration with a haunting voice
- Laughing skull animations and screen vibrations
- Archaic, cryptic language styled as prophecies from 1991 internet ghosts

## User Flow

1. User enters a question in the frontend interface
2. Backend extracts keywords and searches the Gopher Archive
3. Gemini LLM interprets results using a strict "Digital Medium" persona
4. Frontend displays both raw cipher and dramatic interpretation
5. Audio/visual effects create an immersive séance atmosphere

## Key Features

- MCP tool for structured Gopher Archive searching
- Steering document enforces consistent archaic persona
- Agent hooks for automated code quality checks
- Spec-driven development approach
